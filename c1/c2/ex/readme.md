I find a anwser when i google "What happened to IPv1, IPv2, IPv3, and IPv5??"

IPv1, 2, & 3 would be part of the TCP/IP protocols, of which there were 3 versions before the IP protocol was split of of it. IPv4 is actualy the first version of the IP protocol. IPv5 is an experimental TCP/IP protocol called the Internet Stream Protocol that never really went anywhere because increases in badwith made streaming over IPv4 feasible. So IPv5 was never finalized and they skiped to IPv6.
